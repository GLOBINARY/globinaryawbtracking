Foreword
Congratulations! You’ve just taken the first step toward faster, smarter deliveries with Sameday!

This document will help you go through the technical documentation more easily and to understand the operational flow offered by
SamedayRESTful Web-Service, so that in the end you will benefit from an easy integration with our services.
Next steps

In order to start placing shipment orders through the SamedayAPI Service, the following steps should be followed:
1. Obtain a client account on the integration environment.
2. Follow the available technical documentation.
3. Understand the sandbox offered on smd-api / documentation (or use a REST client, for example: postman)
4. Migration

Client account

The Sameday team, through your designated sales agent, will help you obtain a client account for your company. In order to obtain such an
account, certain information concerning your business will be requested and you will also have to provide a pick-up point and at least one
contact person.

Sandbox testing environment

SamedayAPI has an available sandbox that offers a testing environment for each API method and it is available in the “sandbox” tab of each
method. The sandbox has an https authentication method and the credentials can be requested at app.support@sameday.ro.
Terminology used in the documentation

Explanations for various terms used:
Parcel - a shipment, a parcel, a parcel, an individual item. A parcel (or several) form a shipment (an awb).
AWB - refers to shipping. A shipment has a sender, a recipient, reimbursement, etc. An awb/a shipment consists of at least one parcel.
The shipment is the one that carries the refund value and generates the transport cost and not the individual packages (parcels).
AwbNumber is the tracking code of a shipment.
ParcelNumber is the tracking code of a shipment, parcel, package.
Type of shipment: it can be parcel, small parcel, or large parcel (meaning oversized parcel).
Pick-up address/pick-up point/pick-up-point: the address of the customer work point from where a shipment is picked up.
Third party: a third party from whom an expedition can be raised.
Customer contact person: contact details for a person responsible for the pick-up point; will appear on the sender's AWB.
Customer structure in the Sameday system

To place a shipment order, the following data are required:
The pickup points
Contact persons associated with pick-up points
Services available for the current customer account
Mapping of county IDs from the Sameday system
Mapping locality IDs from the Sameday system

These data will not change, therefore it is recommended to save them in your database. If these data will change, you will be notified
in advance.
Optional, but recommended in the case of large volumes of shipments: mapping the localities from the Sameday nomenclature.

The main methods required for integration
Authentication

To use the Sameday RESTful Web-Service, you first need a username and a password, provided after the sign-up process.
After a successful authentication, an authentication token will be generated, this token will be used to authorize the other methods used.
The endpoint called to generate this token is POST/api/authenticate.
Authentication will be done by sending two HTTP headers:
X-AUTH-USERNAME - username will be sent in this header.
X-AUTH-PASSWORD - the password will be sent in this header.
If the credentials are correct, the server will send an authentication token and an expiration date for this token in json format.
Example answer:
1 {
2 "token": "68831048509fe092c89aed48e2660f5da73e6341",
3
"expire_at": "2024-09-24 12:54",
4
"expire_at_utc": "2024-09-24 09:54"
5 }

Authentication for the rest of the methods will be done by sending the X-AUTH-TOKEN header with the value obtained in the 'token' key.
The lifetime of a token is 12 hours, but if the parameter remember_me=1 is added, this token will be valid for 14 days.
It is recommended to save the local token, in your own database, and regenerate it with "X" minutes/hours before expiration
The authentication limit is 12 requests/IP/minute
Pick-up points & contact persons

The endpoint used to get these ids is GET/api/client/pickup-points;

If the client has not yet defined a pickup point, or it is not the desired one, a new pickup point can be added using the
POST/api/client/pickup-points endpoint or by requesting its addition by the technical support team.
List of pick-up points:
It is a GET type request
The url is api/client/pickup-points
The X-AUTH-TOKEN header will be sent
In the sandbox environment, the request will look similar to:

The answer will be as in the screenshot below. Relevant data has been highlighted.

Contact persons are associated with pick-up points, so, in the case of the screenshot, we will have a pick-up point with id 2, which has a
contact person with id 20.
A customer can have several pick-up points, and a pick-up point can have several contact persons, but only one contact person can be set
as default.
If, when creating an AWB, the contact person is not sent, the default contact person will be used; if there is no default contact person, a
random contact person will be used to still allow saving the expedition.

Types of parcels

Fiecare cerere de emitere a unui AWB trebuie sa contina si tipul coletului (packageType) expediat.
Coletele se impart in trei categorii:
PackageType: 0
Represents a parcel weighing between 1.01 kg and 38 kg
PackageType: 1
Represents a package with a weight between 0.01 kg and 1.00 kg
PackageType: 2
It is used for overweight shipments, which weigh more than 38 kg
In the case of overweight shipments, check with the commercial department the existing transshipment solutions.

List of services:
It is a GET type request;
The url is api/client/services;
The X-AUTH-TOKEN header will be sent.

In the sandbox environment, the request will look similar to:

In response, a list of all your available services, paged, will be displayed. The relevant data is highlighted below:

Home delivery service (Nextday 24H)

You will use this service for all local deliveries to your customers home/office.
The ID for this service is 7.
You will find examples in the

API call examples chapter.

Easybox parcel locker delivery (Locker Nextday)

The Locker Nextday service is a delivery option that allows parcels to be delivered to lockers.
Here are the main details about the service:
The service supports cash on delivery and prepaid shipments.

If a locker is full or unavailable, the courier can redirect the parcel to a backup locker configured on their route.
Service ID is 15.
You will find examples in the

API call examples chapter.

Locker2Locker

The Locker2Locker service is a delivery option within the Sameday network that allows parcels to be sent from one locker to another locker.
Here are the key points about this service:
The sender can drop off the parcel in any Sameday locker.
The parcel will be delivered to the locker chosen by the recipient.
If the selected locker is not available (e.g., no free slots), the parcel can be redirected to the nearest available locker or delivered to the
recipient's address.
If the parcel is not picked up by the recipient, it will be returned to the sender's original locker.
API service ID is 51.
You will find examples in the

API call examples chapter.

Crossborder 24H

The Crossborder 24H service enables international home delivery to Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria.
API service ID is 28.
Crossborder Locker Delivery

The Crossborder Locker Delivery service enables international easybox parcel locker deliveries to Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria.
API service ID is 30.
PUDO Sameday Point

PUDO/Sameday Point represents the delivery service at partner commercial points, an extensive network that includes (but is not limited to)
stores, gas stations and other commercial points.
Two new services have been added to the Sameday IT system:
PUDO NextDay (Personal pickup from a fixed point), service ID: 57
Crossborder PUDO NextDay (Personal pickup from an international fixed point), service ID: 58
Considering the diversification of types of fixed locations, the documentation introduces the notion of OOH, which refers to the Out-OfHome network, which includes both lockers and PUDO points.
By adding these new services, the AWB emission endpoints were adapted to include the two services mentioned above.
In order to have a correct integration that includes these two services, the following aspects will have to be taken into account:
Adding the new parameters oohFirstMile and oohLastMile in the request for an AWB issuance.
oohFirstMile = this field is used for the personal delivery option of a package and represents the ID of the respective location.
oohLastMile = this field is used for the option of personal pick-up of a package from a PUDO location and represents the ID of the
respective location.
When issuing an AWB, through the POST endpoint: api/awb, the type of location must be taken into account, as follows:
The PUDO type locations will have the oohType parameter with the value 1, while the easybox type locations will have the oohType
parameter with the value 0.
The easybox type locations have a range of IDs up to the value of 500,000, while the PUDO type locations will have a range of IDs with
a value of over 500,000.
Both pairs of parameters can be used, with the mention that if you want to broadcast on the PUDO service, it is mandatory to use
the new OOH parameters.
It is recommended to use the new parameters for both services, because those previously used will become decommissioned in
the future.

To return Out Of Home (Locker + PUDO) locations, a new endpoint was created called GET /api/client/ooh-locations. It will replicate the
features of the existing GET/api/client/lockers endpoint.
On the new method, the listingType filter has been added, through which we will return:
lockers only
lockers + PUDOs
Also, on the response of the new endpoint, the oohType field was added, as well as specialSchedule, which will contain free days and days
with a special schedule.
Additional changes were also made to the status-sync endpoints, which were adapted to include information about the new service,
SAMEDAY point.
The affected methods are:
GET /api/client/status-sync ,
GET /api/client/xb-status-sync
Thus, in addition to the lockerDetails collection, we will also have a new collection called oohDetails.
The returned response will have identical information on both the lockerDetails and oohDetails collections, for AWBs with delivery to lockers
(easybox).
For AWBs with delivery to PUDO, we will only have information returned on the oohDetails collection.
Obtain PUDO Sameday Point locations:
It is a GET request
The url is /api/client/ooh-locations
The X-AUTH-TOKEN header will be sent

In the sandbox environment, the request will look similar to:
https://api.sameday.ro/api/client/ooh-locations?oohList=500162&listingType=1&countPerPage=100&countryCode=RO

Easybox return shipping (Locker Return)

Procedure:
The buyer will access the online store and selects to retun the product in an Easybox. Note: Each online store will implement the
necessary validations, depending on the specifics of the store (eligible products, return period, etc.)
The AWB will be issued with pick-up from the third party. For the thirdParty, the buyer's data will be sent, and for the recipient, the
customer's data (where the package will be delivered) will be sent
It will be necessary to send the date by which the buyer can load the package into the locker (eligibilityDate). If the buyer does not load
the return into the locker by that date, we will automatically cancel the order. It will be marked with the status Canceled locker order reason Expiry date
It would be ideal to send the dimensions of the package in order to be able to calculate the type of box that we will open for the customer
when it arrives at easybox. If the dimensions cannot be sent, we will set the default box S. If the packaged product will be larger than the
calculated box type, they will have the option to request a larger box. If it does not fit even in the largest box, the buyer will be able to
cancel the order. It will be marked with the status Order canceled locker – reason Canceled by sender at locker

When creating the AWB we will return the charge code (lockerReturnChargeCode) in response. You will need to have a flow through
which you can send the return code to the customer, via email or SMS.
Extra service options

Extra service options are complementary to the transport services and can be added on request.
The most common extra options are the following:
Parcel opening (OPCG)
Exchange parce (SWAP)
Document return (RDOC)
Personal delivery at a fixed point (PDO)
It is not possible to add or assign extra options for the client through the WebService.
If the desired extra options are not visible on your account, please contact the Sameday commercial department.
List of extra options:
It is a GET type request
The URL is api/client/services;
The X-AUTH-TOKEN header will be sent
In response, all services and extra options active on the account will be displayed. Extra options for transport services are displayed in the
serviceOptionalTaxes parameter. Select the appropriate value depending on the package type in the request (packageType: 0, 1 or 2).

The values ​in the field - serviceOptionalTaxes "id" - are unique for each customer account. When implementing the desired extra
option, use the ids returned by the API response.
Counties/provinces, cities and localities

To avoid possible sorting errors, it is recommended to map the Sameday county and locality nomenclature with the client's
nomenclature, and when creating an AWB to send the Sameday county ID and locality ID.
The Sameday system allows the following variants:
The locality ID from the Sameday system - in which case the shipment will enter the operational flow directly
The name of the locality - for which an automatic mapping will be attempted based on some text dictionaries with the localities in the
Sameday nomenclature; if this process fails, the shipment will enter a manual review process and Sameday operators will map the name
sent with a locality from the nomenclature
It is recommended to contact the Sameday support team if you notice inconsistencies in the nomenclature of counties/localities.
List of counties:

It is a GET request
The url is api/geolocation/county
The X-AUTH-TOKEN header will be sent
In the sandbox environment, the request will look similar to:

The answer will be similar to the one in the image below, and the id and name details are relevant.

List of localities:
It is a GET request
The url is api/geolocation/city
The X-AUTH-TOKEN header will be sent
In the sandbox environment, the request will look similar to:

Name, county, postalCode, page, countPerPage filters can also be applied, examples:
name: Sector (and all cities containing the substring 'sector' will be returned)
county: Bucuresti (and all the cities associated with Bucuresti county will be returned)
postalCode: 032 (and all cities with a postal code containing 032 will be returned)
The answer will be similar to the one in the image below, and the id and name details are relevant.

The status of a shipment

To find out the current status of a shipment, Sameday provides several endpoints, depending on the needs of each customer.
URL tracking

The first option is by adding a tracking link to the Sameday website.
The URL is of the form https://sameday.ro/#awb= where after the equal sign, the AWB number of the shipment will be filled.

API retrieval for each AWB

If you are generating AWBs for your local market (examples: RO-RO, HU-HU, BG-BG), use GET /api/client/status-sync
If you are generating AWBs from your local market and delivery crossborder (delivery to another country: examples: RO-HU, HU-RO, etc),
use GET /api/client/xb-status-sync
It is a GET request
Returns the status transitions which took place between 2 timestamps for the current client. * The maximum interval between the 2
timestamps is 2 hours. The results will be paginated
The X-AUTH-TOKEN header will be sent
In the sandbox environment, the request will look similar to:

The answer will be similar to the one in the image below:

Downloading the easybox locker list

The endpoint through which the easybox locker list can be retrieved are GET/api/client/lockers or GET/api/client/ooh-locations.
Please note that GET/api/client/lockers will be deprecated. Please implement GET/api/client/ooh-locations.
It is a GET request.
The X-AUTH-TOKEN header will be sent.
In the sandbox environment, the request will look similar to:

The response will be paginated and will look similar to the one below, where the total number of lockers, the number of pages will be
returned. By default, 500 lockers per page will be returned.
Only the available locations will be displayed. If a location was deactivated, it will not be displayed by the endpoint.

Show map of easybox lockers
Locker PlugIn SDK (React) - Javascript

By installing and using the SDK developed by Sameday, you will reduce both the development time of your own solution on your site, as well
as the costs of this development.
The main functionalities developed in the plugin are:

Filter lockers by the following criteria: County, Easybox Name

Example: search for Sectorul 1 - Bucuresti

Displaying lockers based on user location and zoom in / zoom out option, day mode / night mode
Example: zoomed in, dark mode

Example: zoomed in map, light mode

The banner "Congested delivery point. Delivery in x days" represents an estimate of delivery to the respective Easybox.
To display all the details, click on the desired Easybox. You will be shown the Easybox address, working hours, delivery estimate, and
the cash on delivery payment options available at Easybox (card payment).
Installation steps are available at https://cdn.sameday.ro/locker-plugin/techdoc.html
After installing the SDK, please send the domains (test and production) to the technical support team, in order to generate and provide
the clientId necessary to initialize the map.

Create AWBs

AWBs can be created using the api/awb method, which requires authentication and a valid payload containing shipment details.
Below you will find a list of parameters accepted by the api/awb method:
pickupPoint required
string($pickupPoint id)
Client pickup point ID - represents the warehouse ID from where the awbs are collected by Sameday.
returnLocationId optional
string($pickupPoint id)
Client return pickup point ID - represents the warehouse ID from where the awbs are returned by Sameday in case of failed delivery. This
location id can be different vs the pickupPoint id. If the value is not sent, awbs will be returned to the warehouse from which they were
collected.
contactPerson optional
string($contactPerson id)
Client contact person ID
packageType required
integer
Package Type: 0 -> package (standard dimension packages), 1 -> small package (such as an envelope), 2 -> large package (such as a
freezer, etc)
packageNumber
integer
Number of packages; If this parameter is missing from the request, the awb will be considered incomplete
packageWeight required
number
Total package weight (kg)
service required
string($services id)
Service ID (see the documentation for method: /api/client/services)
awbPayment required
number
AWB payment (Who pays) 1 -> client. By client it means the company that has contract with Sameday. Can only have value 1.
cashOnDelivery required
number
Cash on delivery (can be 0). If the awb has no cashOnDelivery, you must send 0.
